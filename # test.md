## A Changing Society

Summary: Canada became more flexible cause they accepted more immigrants

As social values changed over more than 50 years, Canada became a more flexible and open society. Many took advantage of expanding secondary and postsecondary educational opportunities and a growing number of women entered the professional work force. Most Canadians of Asian descent had in the past been denied the vote in federal and provincial elections. In 1948 the last of these, the Japanese Canadians, gained the right to vote. **Aboriginal people were granted the vote in 1960**. Today every citizen over the age of 18 may vote. Canada welcomed thousands of refugees from Communist oppression, including about 37,000 who escaped Soviet tyranny in Hungary in 1956. With the Communist victory in the Vietnam War in 1975, many Vietnamese fled, including over 50,000 who sought refuge in Canada. The idea of multiculturalism, as a result of 19th- and 20th-century immigration, gained a new impetus. By the 1960s, one-third of Canadians had origins that were neither British nor French, and took pride in preserving their distinct culture in the Canadian fabric. Today, diversity enriches Canadians’ lives, particularly in our cities.

- In 1985, fellow British Columbian **Rick Hansen** circled the globe in a wheelchair to raise funds for spinal cord research. Canadian advances in science and technology are world renowned and have changed the way the world communicates and does business.
